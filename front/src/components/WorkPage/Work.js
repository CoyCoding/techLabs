                  <p>Our Agile process ensures that the specialized software solutions we design and
                  develop are useful and usable by intensely focusing on users, and designing around their wants and needs
                  at all stages of the development lifecycle.</p> <p>Human-Centered Design (HCD) Agile is a framework that
                  designs and develops products and solutions by involving the human perspective in all steps of the
                  process: observing the problem within context, conceptualizing, developing, testing, and implementing the solution..</p>
